          <strong>Pantiss Foundation prompted me to take on responsibility from the start of my career.</strong>
          I became the youngest senior coordinator in the organization in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the years, I gained hands-on learning experience in finding solutions to the toughest 
          socioeconomic challenges prevalent in our society. As a young professional, I was deployed as a 
          project coordinator for Pantiss Community Outreach.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked as a regional manager after that and eventually as a training coordinator. Being a young 
          professional, my first job after graduating was life-changing. When I was first sent to the field as a coordinator-in-training, I was out of my element. Working in remote regions strengthened my skills, and I knew that development work was the career path I wanted to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I traveled to the US to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Global Development with a full scholarship from the University 
          of Chicago. I rejoined the Pantiss Foundation upon returning, where I now oversee multiple leadership 
          initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pantiss Foundation has provided me with numerous opportunities to represent our community on the 
          global stage. I aspire to keep learning and help others to do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
