            Over the past decade, our journey has been a testament to the
            resilience and determination of mining-affected communities. As we
            move forward, the upcoming Mining Villages Affected Summit marks the
            beginning of a transformative chapter â€” one where we collectively
            envision a future built on inclusive growth, sustainable
            development, and community empowerment. Together, we have a
            responsibility to address the challenges faced by these communities
            and drive impactful change for the people, the environment, and
            future generations.
